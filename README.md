# Steamy - Steampunk hero platform shooter


### Most important things and problems we're tackling in the project:

- **MVVM** - We're creating our own MVVM implementation, where models are clear classes,
view-models are monobehaviours and views are GameObjects.

- **Teamwork** - This is our first big project with more than 4 members. We're learning not
only how to work with git, but also about connecting programmers, graphic artists and designers work.

- **Input** - We've created our own way of managing input for bigger projects. 
(This will probably be depracated when new Input System leaves beta).

- **Travis CI** - We're using continuous integration service in order to build and test project.
